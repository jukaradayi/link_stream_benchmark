Link Stream Anomalies
=====================

* The anomalies are generated seperately, by specifically taking the graph
  and timeserie anomalies.

* Since the "normal" and "anomaly" link-streams are independently 
  uniformly picked, we need to check that no multiple edges are created when
  adding the "anomaly" to the "normal" link-stream. When a multiple edge is
  detected, random swap targetting those specifically are made to ensure
  that we have a simple link-stream. A final pass of random swap is made
  to ensure that no multiple edges happen in the total graph.

Getting rid of multiple edges
-----------------------------

* When multiple edges are detected, we do the following:

  - For each multiple edge :math:`e_1`, do:

      - Choose between "normal" and "anomaly" link-stream with probability 0.5

      - In chosen link stream, pick an edge :math:`e_2` uniformly at random that satisfies the following conditions:
            
            - :math:`e_1 \neq e_2`

            - swapping :math:`e_1` and :math:`e_2` reduces the number of multiple edges by at least 1
      
      - If swap is accepted, swap :math:`e_1` and :math:`e_2`, otherwise reject swap and pick another edge :math:`e_2`
