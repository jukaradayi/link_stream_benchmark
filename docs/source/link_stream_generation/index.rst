Link Stream Generation
======================

* Given a weighted graph and a timeserie, we can now generate a link stream.

* To generate a link-stream, the `genbip <TODO LINK TO GENBIP DOC>`_ package is used.
  By considering the weighted edges as the top nodes and the timeseries values as the bottome nodes
  we simply generate a bipartite graph
