Datasets
======== 

* For the benchmark, we make available three types of datasets. Each dataset is made of a linkstream :math:`S=(T,V,E)`, where :math:`T` is a set of time instants, :math:`V` is a set of nodes, and :math:`E \subseteq T \times V \otimes V` is a set of links, such that :math:`(t,u,v)` means that link between nodes :math:`(u,v)` happens at time :math:`t`.

Raw Datasets
------------

* Datasets that are publicly available, that we distribute with limited modifications. For most of them, we only update the format to homogenize them.

  - Mawi: packet transfers via upd or tcp

  - Taxi : taxi trips in new york, on a :math:`3000 \times 3000` grid

  - Peru : money transfer in peru during an extreme weather event

  - Bitcoin : bitcoin money transfer

Data-Model Datasets
-------------------

* Using some properties extracted from the previous datasets (degree sequences, weight sequences, timeseries), we generate random "normal" and "anomaly" graphs, and random "normal" and "anomaly" timeseries.

* To generate the graphs, we use a Havel-Hakimi generator, followed by random edge swap, to generate the random graph using the degree sequences, and distribute the weights at random over the edges.

* To generate the timeseries, we keep the timestamps and shuffle the values over the timestamps.

Random-Model Datasets
---------------------

* Finally, we distribute datasets generates from scratch using generation models.

* For graphs, we use an Erdos-Renyi model to generate the "normal" and "anomaly" graphs. We then distribute the weights uniformly such that the sum of the weights is the number of interactions set as input.

* For timeseries, we use randomly uniformly distribute the values such that the cumulative sum reaches the number of interactions set as input.
