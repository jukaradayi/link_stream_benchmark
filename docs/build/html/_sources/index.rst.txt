Benchmark's documentation
=========================

- This documentation presents the Link Stream Generation benchmark.

- This project gather several tools used to generate uniformly randomly picked Link-Streams given certain parameters, with "anomalies".

- In this package, you will find three categories of tools : 

  * preparator : 
                Tools used to gather certain specific datasets (refered as nyc_taxi and MAWI), and process all linkstream datasets to be in the same format.

  * processor : Generate a random graph and a random timeserie given certain parameters. The graph and timeserie can either be generated by shuffling real datasets, or be generated using random models.

  * link-stream generator: Given a graph and a timeserie, generate a uniformly randomly picked link-stream.

- This documentation will present how to use each component, and detail their implementation.
